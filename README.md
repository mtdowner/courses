# 😲 Oh wow, a visitor!

It shan’t be! Never more, welcome to my repo!

This is my repository filled with goodies. Not really. But kind of. You’ll find a bunch of nonsense relating to me and my “work.” Yeah.. let’s call it “work.”

Here’s what you’ll find:

- links to blogs, websites, etc.
- projects I’ve surprisingly completed
- any courses you can take with me as the teacher—it’s fun.. ish
- affiliate links that are actually worth you’re time like getting free stuff
- codes and snippets that seem to have compiled everywhere except for the same folder

There you have it!

Or exit out, it’s a free country. 🇺🇸
