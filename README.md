# ðŸ˜² Oh wow, a visitor!

It shan't be! Never more, welcome to my repo!

This is my repository filled with goodies. Not really. But kind of. You'll find a bunch of nonsense relating to me and my "work." Yeah.. letâ€™s call it "work."

Here's what you might find:

- links to blogs, websites, etc.
- projects I've surprisingly completed
- info about and related to courses you take with me as your teacher--it' fun.. ish
- decent affiliate and referral links
- codes and snippets that seem to have been saved everywhere except for the same folder

There you have it!
