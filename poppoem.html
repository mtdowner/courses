<h1>
  Poem to my pops
</h1>
<p>
  Popsicle, oh popsicle,
  <br>
  you make me sweat and sweat!
  <br>
  <br>
  To the freezer, I must go.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahh, delicious until I begin to sweat,
  <br>
  yet again!
  <br>
  <br>
  Sneaky, popsicle, I now see your tricks.
  <br>
  <br>
  You will not fool me no,
  <br>
  not again!
  <br>
  <br>
  Farewell, popsicle:
  <br>
  into the trash you must go.
</p>
